## ** Goal **

My personal website includes a portfolio of these projects to showcase my learning and developing skills along with basic contact information.

The primary users for this site are mostly recruiters and hiring managers for coop positions that I am applying to.
I am the main secondary user for this site because I need to maintain the site and keep it up to date with new projects that I complete.

For the primary users, I want to make sure the site is simple to navigate and all details are readable across mobile, tablet and laptop sized devices.
As a secondary user, I want the site to be easy to maintain and add new projects without major development work.

## ** Process **

Before writing any code, I designed all of the pages that I wanted on my site in Figma.
After the design, I went through the prototype and identified the custom components I wanted to develop.
These steps are the common start of all of my persoal project as they allow me to develop with a plan.

For the development of my personal website, I used Gatsby.
From their website:

> Gatsby enables developers to build fast, secure, and powerful websites using a React-based framework and innovative data layer that makes integrating different content, APIs, and services into one web experience incredibly simple.

This was my first time working with Gatsby but it uses React componenets so it was a good middle ground where I could leverage past experience while learning about a new framework.

I used Gatsby's GraphQL data layer to store my projects in .mdx files and programttically generate their project cards and pages from the files, making adding new projects in the future simple.

Finally, I used Gatsby cloud for a simple, integrated deployment of my site.

## ** Next Steps & Lessons **

My primary next step for this site is purchasing a domain and integrating with Google Analytics.
I hope to use the user behavior information from Google Analytics to inform design changes in the future.

This project was a great experience to learn about Gatsby and GraphQL while updating my personal website to a clean, responsive design.
