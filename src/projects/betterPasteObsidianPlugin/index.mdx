## Context

I've been taking notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the past 6ish months and it's been working well. However, it's pretty common that I'll be taking notes about a paper which is open in a PDF side by side with my notes, when I try to copy a section out of the paper and paste it into my notes and the formatting is ugly, there's plenty of extra newlines and blank lines. This quick plugin filters out the newlines and hyphenated words with a new 'clean paste' command.

It was pretty easy to quickly spin up this plugin, working off the [sample plugin template](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) that the Obsidian team provided. It was also neat to switch to Typescript after thinking in Python for the past while. With the help of Copilot and Claude, the change in syntax felt pretty effortless. The plugin is pending approval to be available as an Obsidian

I'm looking at expanding the functionality to better handle Math and Latex which is another big pain point for me while taking notes but that seems to be a much more complicated can of worms.
