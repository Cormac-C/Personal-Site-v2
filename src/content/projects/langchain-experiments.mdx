## Goal

I used this project as an opportunity to gain experience building LLM enabled apps with the [Langchain framework](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction). Additionally, I took this as an opportunity to try out [Remix](https://remix.run/), a React framework.

The goal was to experiment with some of the prebuilt functionalities in Langchain using OpenAI's API so that I had some experience to bring to future projects.

## Process

I started the project with Remix's [Indie Stack Template](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack)

Given that this project was meant as a learning experience I did not prioritize building very maintainable code.

Instead, I explored Langchain's API piece by piece, creating small demos of the off the shelf functionality that the framework offers.

## Next Steps & Lessons

With the benefit of hindsight, it probably didn't make sense to explore too new frameworks at the same time. I think I worked around Remix rather than learning how to use it properly because I was focused on using Langchain. I will probably revisit Remix in the future.

With that said, this experience with Langchain was extremely valuable when I used the framework at work at Valence Labs shortly after finishing my experiments.

While I may not be proud of the quality of code within this codebase, it was a great learning experience and a fun opportunity to tinker.
